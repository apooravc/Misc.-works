# Misc.-works

This is the place where I intend to keep all of my simple projects made using HTML, CSS and JS. I've written a brief description about each project including what my objectives were before starting each project and what I learned during the process of making each such project.

My goal of documenting these projects is that we learn stuff by doing it and it gets a lot easier to create something, especially when you're a beginner, if you have an example of how things work.
